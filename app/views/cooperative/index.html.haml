            %strong What is The Cooperative?
            %br
            CIW strives to genuinely invest in a better-connected, well-versed Chicago. That means we’re dedicated to showcasing innovative, empowering and community-driven organizations alongside our superior programming. In 2013, we’re launching a revamped and refined Community Partnerships program, aligned with our mission of nurturing great ideas and bolstering actionable initiatives. This is our distinctive community; our collection of great ambitions, profound ideas and stellar relationships: This is <strong>The Cooperative</strong>.
          %p But for CIW, the old days of networking are over; and we’re standing up against industry-specific meet-ups and tired cocktail hours. The Co-op is the new-age social chamber of commerce; where nonprofits meet tech junkies, artists meet business leaders and entrepreneurs meet social radicals. Bottom line, this is a social ecosystem of deeply motivated, boldly active individuals striving to spark change across this city and the world. Do you have what it takes?
