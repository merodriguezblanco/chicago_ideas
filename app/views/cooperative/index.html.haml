            %strong The Co-op is a movement. It is made up of innovative, empowering and commmunity-driven individuals breaking down silos and sparking change across Chicago.
            In 2013, we're launching a revamped and refined Community Partnerships program, aligned with our mission of nurturing great ideas and bolstering actionable initiatives.
            %strong This is our distinctive community;
            our collection of great ambitions, profound ideas and deep relationships:
            %strong This is The Cooperative.
          %p
            Members of the Co-op share our commitment of investing in this great city, through building or leading socially vested businesses, innovative nonprofits and
            grassroots initiatives pioneering what it means to be an entrepreneur. They're doing work with a purpose. And we're bringing them together to achieve even
            greater things through this close network of thinkers.
